**Good evening, I’m Riccardo Gatti.** From a young age, I’ve been driven by a passion for science, entrepreneurship, and the sharing of knowledge believing it to be the foundation of positive societal change. During my time at Liceo (high school), I began engaging in research and intellectual exchange with figures like Bruno Bertotti, experiences that deeply influenced my path. At 23, I embarked on an independent professional journey, publishing research with institutions such as MDPI and Wolfram Research, and co-founding *EaziU*, a startup focused on technology for scientific progress. I've collaborated with organizations like INBB, exploring how information theory intersects with biology. My work bridges academia and entrepreneurship, with initiatives that promote scientific communication and connect research with the business world. In 2024, I contributed to the *REXASI-PRO* project - developing AI solutions for mobility and inclusion - and founded *OneBeWhole* to support emerging disciplines in response to today’s global challenges.

Today, I remain active in outreach, research, and education, believing that verified, well-communicated knowledge is vital in an age of abundant AI-generated information. My mission is to ensure that science and technology remain tools for shared growth and responsibility.

**Senior Researcher** My mathematical research spans number theory, Riemannian manifolds, and information theory. Mathematics, to me, is the art of ideas and the logic of thought.

**Co-Founder & Technical Director** I specialize in simplifying complex technologies by focusing development on user-friendly solutions—where real innovation lies in making complexity serve functionality.

**Philosophy** Let the one be the whole. Let the Universe act. She knows the way.
